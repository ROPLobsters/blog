In this episode Austin and Nathan examine the [3CX debacle](https://www.securityweek.com/cascading-supply-chain-attack-3cx-hacked-after-employee-downloaded-trojanized-app/), which leads to discussion of the [existential threat](https://www.securityweek.com/symantec-north-korean-3cx-hackers-also-hit-critical-infrastructure-orgs/) of increasing complication and over-specialization. Then, they talk about how much money security researchers made when they helped Google [fix a few issues in the Chrome Browser](https://www.securityweek.com/google-patches-second-chrome-zero-day-vulnerability-of-2023/). Was it enough to continue to dissuade highly skilled technicians from joining the dark side? Last, join as they discuss why you might need to think twice before opening that job description a recruiter sent you on LinkedIn, especially if it is your [dream job](https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/lazarus-group-adds-linux-malware-to.html).
