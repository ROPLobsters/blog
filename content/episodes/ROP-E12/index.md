In this episode, Austin and Nathan untangle the [web of government](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-cyber-oversight-of-critical-infrastructure-is-failing-report-warns-c9f6fb57) oversight responsibilities for different critical infrastructure industries, discuss the [stealth capabilities of BatCloak](https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/cybercriminals-using-powerful-batcloak.html), explore villainous [ransomware attacks against hospitals](https://healthitsecurity.com/news/cybersecurity-incident-at-mercyone-triggers-potential-patient-data-loss), and examine how the [state of Maryland is turning small businesses into security superheroes](https://news.yahoo.com/maryland-tough-cyber-security-sen-085403841.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIS8110Ut3-vnlgps2QPAIbi9RdDQrOCiIgzh5R2xURnKh9WKF29H4Zc7-tJvsC6XjnKvMR9WyhLh1UlScho5LEBKmXbnI2gibJh3V5zVQM9ineEchPM9-MnWq8Nn6ELp9WYhp4lPkwU1TX-M2DRwPpI4JShsdxWrWUMitqIzXW7) all while making various allusions to Spiderman in honor of "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse".
