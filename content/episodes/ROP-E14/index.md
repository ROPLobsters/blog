We have the great pleasure of being joined by [Dr. Martin Carlisle](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/Carlisle-Martin.html), a highly respected expert in cyber security and Professor of Computer Science at Texas A&M University. Listen as the Lobsters and Dr. Carlisle discuss the White House's new [Cyber Trust Mark for IOT devices](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-new-consumer-label-for-smart-home-devices/) (see [the following](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.02042022-2.pdf) for more technical information), [formal verification for secure programs](http://www.faginfamily.net/barry/Papers/Fagin%20Carlisle%20Klanderman%20COMPSAC%202017.pdf), and the joy of teaching computer science to English majors.
