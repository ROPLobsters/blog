We're back with episode 11! This time listen in to hear Austin and Nathan discuss how AI could be used to fool your [Grandma](https://www.tmj4.com/news/i-team/cyber-security-experts-law-enforcement-warn-of-uptick-in-ai-scams), why [Rust](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/how-mastering-rust-can-advance-your-career-in-cybersecurity/) is the future of compiled code, and the reason you might want to pull out of your investment in the [Gigabyte](https://www.securityweek.com/organizations-warned-of-backdoor-feature-in-hundreds-of-gigabyte-motherboards/) computer hardware company. Boy, oh boy do they have all the answers in this one!
