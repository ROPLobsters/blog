Austin and Nathan are back at it! This time they discuss a current epidemic of [citrix device backdoor installations](https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/nearly-2000-citrix-netscaler-instances.html?m=1), and some recent publications detailing [hopeful post-quantum cryptographic solutions](https://www.securityweek.com/google-releases-security-key-implementation-resilient-to-quantum-attacks). They also discuss the ways some are using [AI to fight botnets](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/this-israeli-ai-firm-is-revolutionizing-cybersecuritys-war-on-bots-opinion/ar-AA1fjDmq) and current efforts to give [cyber security license training to students](https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2023/cyber-security--pen-licences--to-arm-students.html).
